## Exercise 1.15

The sine of an angle (specified in radians) can be computed by making use of the approximation $\sin x\approx x$ if $x$ is sufficiently small, and the trigonometric identity

$$
$$

to reduce the size of the argument of $\sin$. (For purposes of this exercise an angle is considered “sufficiently small” if its magnitude is not greater than 0.1 radians.) These ideas are
incorporated in the following procedures:

```scheme
(define (cube x) (* x x x))

(define (p x) (- (* 3 x) (* 4 (cube x))))

(define (sine angle)
    (if (not (> (abs angle) 0.1))
        angle
        (p (sine (/ angle 3.0)))))
```

a. How many times is the procedure p applied when (sine
12.15) is evaluated?

b. What is the order of growth in space and number of
steps (as a function of a) used by the process generated
by the sine procedure when (sine a) is evaluated?


**Ans**

a.

 $(sine \space 12.15) \leftarrow (sine \space 4.05) \leftarrow (sine \space 1.35) \leftarrow (sine \space 0.45) \leftarrow (sine \space 0.15) \leftarrow (sine \space 0.05) \leftarrow 0.05$

 所以一共是6次

 b. 

 每执行一次 $(sine\space x)$, $a$ 的值将会变为原来的 $\frac{1}{3}$ 终结条件如下 $\frac{a}{3^n} < 0.1$ 转换即为 $n> \log_3{10a}$ 所以规模的增长为 $lg{n}$
