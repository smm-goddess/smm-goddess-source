## Exercise 1.28

One variant of the Fermat test that cannot be fooled is called the Miller-Rabin test (Miller 1976; Rabin 1980). This starts from an alternate form of Fermat’s Little Theorem, which states that if $n$ is a prime number and $a$ is any positive integer less than $n$, then $a$ raised to the $(n-1)-st$ power is congruent to $1$ modulo $n$. To test the primality of a number $n$ by the Miller-Rabin test, we pick a random number $a < n$ and raise a to the $(n-1)-st$ power modulo $n$ using the `expmod` procedure. However, whenever we perform the squaring step in `expmod`, we check to see if we have discovered a “nontrivial square root of 1 modulo $n$,” that is, a number not equal to $1$ or $n-1$ whose square is equal to $1$ modulo $n$. It is possible to prove that if such a nontrivial square root of $1$ exists, then $n$ is not prime. It is also possible to prove that if $n$ is an odd number that is not prime, then, for at least half the numbers $a < n$, computing a $n-1$ in this way will reveal a nontrivial square root of $1$ modulo $n$. (This is why the Miller-Rabin test cannot be fooled.) Modify the `expmod` procedure to signal if it discovers a nontrivial square root of $1$, and use this to implement the Miller-Rabin test with a procedure analogous to fermat-test. Check your procedure by testing various known primes and non-primes. Hint: One convenient way to make `expmod` signal is to have it return $0$.

**Ans**

```scheme
(define (expmod base exp m)
    (cond ((= exp 0) 1)
          ((nontrivial-square-root? base m) 0) ;改进
          ((even? exp)
                (remainder
                    (square (expmod base (/ exp 2) m))
                     m))
          (else
                (remainder
                    (* base (expmod base (- exp 1) m))
                     m))))
```

根据题意,先在`expmod`中添加对非平凡平方根的判定,判定方式如下:

```scheme

(define (!= x y)
    (not (= x y)))

(define (nontrivial-square-root? base m)
    (and (!= base 1)
         (!= base (- m 1))
         (= (remainder (square base) m) 1)))
```

然后是 Miller-Robin 测试的主体:

```scheme
(define (non-zero-random n)
    (+ 1 (random n)))

(define (miller-robin-iter n times)
    (cond ((= times 0) #t)
          ((= (expmod (non-zero-random n) (- n 1) n) 1)
              (miller-robin-iter n (- times 1)))
          (else #f)))

(define (miller-robin-test? n)
    (miller-robin-iter n (ceiling (/ n 2))))
```

对 $n$ 做 $\lceil\frac{n}{2}\rceil$ 次验证,如果全部通过则认为是质数,对fermat检测判断错误的6个数字做测试,均成功检测
