## Exercise 1.38:

In 1737, the Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler published a memoir De Fractionibus Continuis, which included a continued fraction expansion for $e - 2$, where $e$ is the base of the natural logarithms. In this fraction, the $N_i$ are all 1, and the $D_i$ are successively $1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 6, 1, 1, 8,\cdots$. Write a program that uses your `cont-frac` procedure from Exercise 1.37 to approximate e, based on Euler’s expansion.

**Ans**

```scheme
(define (d-helper k)
    (if (= 0 (remainder k 3))
        (* 2 (+ 1 (/ k 3)))
        1))

(define (d k)
    (if (or (= k 1) (= k 2))
        k ;base case 1 2
        (d-helper (- k 2)))) ; 1 1 4 1 1 6 1 1 8

(+ 2 (cont-frac
    (lambda (i) 1.0)
    d
    100))
```

k 为 100 的时候,计算得 $e=2.7182818284590455$
