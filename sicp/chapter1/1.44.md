## Exercise 1.44

The idea of smoothing a function is an important concept in signal processing. If $f$ is a function and $dx$ is some small number, then the smoothed version of $f$ is the function whose value at a point $x$ is the average of $f(x-dx)$, $f(x)$, and $f(x+dx)$. Write a procedure smooth that takes as input a procedure that computes $f$ and returns a procedure that computes the smoothed $f$ . It is sometimes valuable to repeatedly smooth a function (that is, smooth the smoothed function, and so on) to obtain the $n$-fold smoothed function. Show how to generate the $n$-fold smoothed function of any given function using smooth and repeated from Exercise 1.43.

**Ans**

```scheme

(define dx 0.0001)

(define (smooth f)
    (lambda (x)
        (/ (+ (f (+ x dx)) (f x) (f (- x dx))) 3)))
```

多重迭代

```scheme
(define (n-th-smooth-func f n)
    ((repeat smooth n) f))
```
