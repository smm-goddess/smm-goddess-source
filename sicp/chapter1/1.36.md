## Exercise 1.36

Modify `fixed-point` so that it prints the sequence of approximations it generates, using the `newline` and `display` primitives shown in Exercise 1.22. Then find a solution to $x^x = 1000$ by finding a fixed point of $x \mapsto \log(1000)/\log(x)$. (Use Scheme’s primitive log procedure, which computes natural logarithms.) Compare the number of steps this takes with and without average damping. (Note that you cannot start `fixed-point` with a guess of 1, as this would cause division by $\log(1) = 0$.)

**Ans**

原来的程序为:

```scheme
(define tolerance 0.00001)

(define (fixed-point f first-guess)
    (define (close-enough? v1 v2)
            (< (abs (- v1 v2)) tolerance))
    (define (try guess)
            (let ((next (f guess)))
            (if (close-enough? guess next)
                next
                (try next))))
    (try first-guess))
```

修改后的程序为:

```scheme
(define tolerance 0.00001)

(define (fixed-point f first-guess)
    (define (close-enough? v1 v2)
            (< (abs (- v1 v2)) tolerance))
    (define (display-and-try next)
        (newline)
        (display next)
        (try next))
    (define (display-and-return result)
        (newline)
        (display result)
        result)
    (define (try guess)
            (let ((next (f guess)))
            (if (close-enough? guess next)
                (display-and-return next)
                (display-and-try next))))
    (try first-guess))
```

计算 $x^x = 1000$ 中的$x$

```scheme
(define x
    (fixed-point
        (lambda (y) (/ (log 1000) (log y)))
        2.0))
```

最后结果为 $4.555532270803653$ 总共有34次逼近

如果有`average-damping`

```scheme
(define x
    (fixed-point
        (lambda (y) (/ (log 1000) (log y)))
        2.0))
```

最后结果为 $4.555537551999825$,总共有 9 次逼近
