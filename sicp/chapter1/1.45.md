##Exercise 1.45

We saw in Section 1.3.3 that attempting to compute square roots by naively finding a fixed point of $y\mapsto x/y$ does not converge, and that this can be fixed by average damping. The same method works for finding cube roots as fixed points of the average-damped $y\mapsto x/y^2$ . Unfortunately, the process does not work for fourth roots-a single average damp is not enough to make a fixed-point search for $y\mapsto x/y^3$ converge. On the other hand, if we average damp twice (i.e., use the average damp of the average damp of $y\mapsto x/y^3$ ) the fixed-point search does converge. Do some experiments to determine how many average damps are required to compute $n^{th}$ roots as a fixed-point search based upon repeated average damping of $y\mapsto x/y^{n−1}$ . Use this to implement a simple procedure for computing $n^{th}$ roots using `fixed-point`,`average-damp`,and the `repeated` procedure of Exercise 1.43. Assume that any arithmetic operations you need are available as primitives.

**Ans**

程序如下:

```scheme
(define (power x n)
    (define (power-iter result base n)
        (cond ((= n 0) result)
              ((even? n) (power-iter result (square base) (/ n 2)))
              (else (power-iter (* result base) base (- n 1)))))
    (power-iter 1 x n))

(define (root x n)
    (fixed-point
        ((repeat average-damping 2) (lambda (y) (/ x (power y (- n 1))))) ;只需要修改repeat average-dumping
            1.0))                                                         ;后面的数字就可以用于

(define (test-root n)
    (root (power 2 n) n))

```

测试结果如下:

| 开方次数 | average-damping次数 |
| :------: | :-----------------: |
|    2     |          0          |
|    3     |          1          |
|    4     |          2          |
|    5     |          2          |
|    6     |          2          |
|    7     |          2          |
|    8     |          3          |

猜测结果为$\lfloor\log_2n\rfloor$次

修改`(root x n)`如下

```scheme
(define (root x n)
    (fixed-point 
        ((repeat average-damping (floor (log n 2))) (lambda (y) (/ x (power y (- n 1)))))
            1.0))

```

程序运行正常
