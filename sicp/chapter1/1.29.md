## Exercise 1.29

Simpson’s Rule is a more accurate method of numerical integration than the method illustrated above. Using Simpson’s Rule, the integral of a function f between a and b is approximated as
$$\frac{h}{3}(y_0 + 4y_1 + 2y_2 + 4y_3 + 2y_4+\cdots+2y_{n-2} + 4y_{n-1} + y_n)$$
where $h=(b-a)/n$, for some even integer n, and $y_k = f (a + kh)$. (Increasing $n$ increases the accuracy of the approximation.) Define a procedure that takes as arguments $f$ , $a$, $b$, and $n$ and returns the value of the integral, computed using Simpson’s Rule. Use your procedure to integrate cube between 0 and 1 (with n = 100 and n = 1000), and compare the results to those of the integral procedure shown above.

**Ans**

```scheme
(define (sum term a next b)
    (if (> a b)
        0
        (+ (term a)
        (sum term (next a) next b))))

(define (inc n)
    (+ n 1))

(define (simpson-integral f a b n)
    (define h (/ (- b a) n))
    (define (fn-multi r)
            (cond ((or (= r 1) (= r n)) 1)
                  ((even? r) 2)
                  (else 4)))
    (define (nth-param n)
        (+ a (* h n)))
    (define (fn r)
        (* (fn-multi r) (f (nth-param r))))
    (if (even? n)
        (/ (* h (sum fn 1 inc n)) 3.0)
        (simpson-integral f a b (+ n 1))))
```
