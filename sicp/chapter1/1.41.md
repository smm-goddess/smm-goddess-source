## Exercise 1.41

Define a procedure double that takes a procedure of one argument as argument and returns a procedure that applies the original procedure twice. For example, if inc is a procedure that adds 1 to its argument, then (double inc) should be a procedure that adds 2. What value is returned by

`(((double (double double)) inc) 5)`

**Ans**

```scheme
(define (double f)
    (lambda (x)
        (f (f x))))
```

`(((double (double double)) inc) 5) = 21`

分析:  
令:(double double) = dd  
((double (double double)) inc) = ((double dd) inc)  
= (dd (dd inc))

(dd inc) = ((double double) inc)  
= ((lambda (x) (double (double x))) inc)  
= (double (double inc))  
= (double (lambda (x) (inc (inc) x)))  
记(inc (inc x)) = inc-2  
=(double inc-2)  
= (lambda (x) (inc-2 (inc-2 x)))  
记 (inc-2 (inc-2 x)) = inc-4

(dd (dd inc)) = (dd inc-4)  
=((double double) inc-4)  
=(double (double inc-4))  
=(double inc-8)  
=inc-16

原式=(inc-16 5) = 21
