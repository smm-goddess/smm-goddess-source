## Exercise 2.3

Implement a representation for rectangles in a plane. (Hint: You may want to make use of Exercise 2.2.) In terms of your constructors and selectors, create procedures that compute the perimeter and the area of a given rectangle. Now implement a different representation for rectangles. Can you design your system with suitable abstraction barriers, so that the same perimeter and area procedures will work using either representation?

**Ans**

```scheme
(define (make-rec x1 y1 x2 y2)
  (cons (make-point x1 y1)
        (make-point x2 y2)))

(define (square-rec rec)
  (* (x-length rec) (y-length rec)))

(define (length-rec rec)
  (* (+ (x-length rec) (y-length rec)) 2))

(define (x-length rec)
  (abs (- (x-point (start-point rec)) (x-point (end-point rec)))))

(define (y-length rec)
  (abs (- (y-point (start-point rec)) (y-point (end-point rec)))))

(define (start-point rec)
  (car rec))

(define (end-point rec)
  (cdr rec))
```
