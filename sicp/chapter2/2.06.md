## Exercise 2.6

In case representing pairs as procedures wasn’t mind-boggling enough, consider that, in a language that can manipulate procedures, we can get by without numbers (at least insofar as non-negative integers are concerned) by implementing $0$ and the operation of adding 1 as

```scheme
(define zero (lambda (f) (lambda (x) x)))
(define (add-1 n)
    (lambda (f) (lambda (x) (f ((n f) x)))))
```

This representation is known as _Church numerals_ , after its inventor, Alonzo Church, the logician who invented the $\lambda$-calculus. Define one and two directly (not in terms of `zero` and `add-1`). (Hint: Use substitution to evaluate `(add-1 zero)` ). Give a direct definition of the addition procedure $+$ (not in terms of repeated application of add-1 ).

**Ans**

```scheme
(define zero
  (lambda (f)
    (lambda (x)
      x)))

(define (add-1 n)
  (lambda (f) (lambda (x) (f (n f) x))))

(define one
  (lambda (f)
    (lambda (x)
      (f x))))

(define two
  (lambda (f)
    (lambda (x)
      (f (f x)))))

(define (add n m)
  (lambda (f)
    (lambda (x) ((m f) ((n f) x)))))
```
