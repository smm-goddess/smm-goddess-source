## Exercise 2.11

In passing, Ben also cryptically comments: “By testing the signs of the endpoints of the intervals, it is possible to break `mul-interval` into nine cases, only one of which requires more than two multiplications.” Rewrite this procedure using Ben’s suggestion.

**Ans**

```scheme
(define (mul-interval x y)
  (cond ((and (>= (lower-bound x) 0) (>= (lower-bound y) 0))
               (make-interval (* (lower-bound x) (lower-bound y))
                              (* (upper-bound x) (upper-bound y))))
        ((and (>= (lower-bound x) 0) (<= (upper-bound y) 0))
              (make-interval (* (upper-bound x) (lower-bound y))
                             (* (lower-bound x) (upper-bound y))))
        ((and (>= (lower-bound x) 0) (and (> (upper-bound y) 0) (< (lower-bound y) 0)))
              (make-interval (* (upper-bound x) (lower-bound y))
                             (* (upper-bound x) (upper-bound y))))
        ((and (<= (upper-bound x) 0) (>= (lower-bound y) 0))
               (make-interval (* (lower-bound x) (upper-bound y))
                              (* (upper-bound x) (lower-bound y))))
        ((and (<= (upper-bound x) 0) (<= (upper-bound y) 0))
              (make-interval (* (upper-bound x) (upper-bound y))
                             (* (lower-bound x) (lower-bound y))))
        ((and (<= (upper-bound x) 0) (and (> (upper-bound y) 0) (< (lower-bound y) 0)))
              (make-interval (* (lower-bound x) (upper-bound y))
                             (* (lower-bound x) (lower-bound y))))
        ((and (and (> (upper-bound x) 0) (< (lower-bound x) 0)) (>= (lower-bound y) 0))
               (make-interval (* (lower-bound x) (upper-bound y))
                              (* (upper-bound x) (upper-bound y))))
        ((and (and (> (upper-bound x) 0) (< (lower-bound x) 0)) (<= (upper-bound y) 0))
              (make-interval (* (upper-bound x) (lower-bound y))
                             (* (lower-bound x) (lower-bound y))))
        ((and (and (> (upper-bound x) 0) (< (lower-bound x) 0)) (and (> (upper-bound y) 0) (< (lower-bound y) 0)))
              (make-interval (min (* (upper-bound x) (lower-bound y)) (* (lower-bound x) (upper-bound y)))
                             (max (* (upper-bound x) (upper-bound y)) (* (lower-bound x) (lower-bound y)))))))
