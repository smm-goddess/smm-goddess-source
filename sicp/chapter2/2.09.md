## Exercise 2.9

The $width$ of an interval is half of the difference between its upper and lower bounds. The width is a measure of the uncertainty of the number specified by the interval. For some arithmetic operations the width of the result of combining two intervals is a function only of the widths of the argument intervals, whereas for others the width of the combination is not a function of the widths of the argument intervals. Show that the width of the sum (or difference) of two intervals is a function only of the width of the intervals being added (or subtracted). Give examples to show that this is not true for multiplication or division.

**Ans**

sum

```scheme
(define (add-interval x y)
  (make-interval (+ (lower-bound x) (lower-bound y))
                 (+ (upper-bound x) (upper-bound y))))
```

width

```scheme
(define (width x)
    (- (upper-bound x) (lower-bound x)))
```

```scheme
(add-interval x y)
= (make-interval (+ (lower-bound x) (lower-bound y))
                 (+ (upper-bound x) (upper-bound y)))
= (make-interval (+ (lower-bound x) (lower-bound y))
                 (+ (+ (lower-bound x) (width x)) (+ (lower-bound y) (width y))))
= (make-interval (+ (lower-bound x) (lower-bound y))
                 (+ (+ (lower-bound x) (lower-bound y)) (+ (width x) (width y))))
```

$width(x + y) = width(x) + width(y)$

证毕
