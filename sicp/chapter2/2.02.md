## Exercise 2.2

Consider the problem of representing line segments in a plane. Each segment is represented as a pair of points: a starting point and an ending point. Define a constructor `make-segment` and selectors `start-segment` and `end-segment` that define the representation of segments in terms of points. Furthermore, a point can be represented as a pair of numbers: the $x$ coordinate and the $y$ coordinate. Accordingly, specify a constructor `make-point` and selectors `x-point` and `y-point` that define this representation. Finally, using your selectors and constructors, define a procedure `midpoint-segment` that takes a line segment as argument and returns its midpoint (the point whose coordinates are the average of the coordinates of the endpoints). To try your procedures, you’ll need a way to print points:

```scheme
(define (print-point p)
    (newline)
    (display "(")
    (display (x-point p))
    (display ",")
    (display (y-point p))
    (display ")"))
```

**Ans**

```scheme
(define (make-point x y)
  (cons x y))

(define (x-point point)
  (car point))

(define (y-point point)
  (cdr point))

(define (make-segment x1 y1 x2 y2)
  (cons (make-point x1 y1) (make-point x2 y2)))

(define (start-segment segment)
  (car segment))

(define (end-segment segment)
  (cdr segment))

(define (midpoint-segment segment)
  (make-point (average (x-point (start-segment segment)) (x-point (end-segment segment)))
              (average (y-point (start-segment segment)) (y-point (end-segment segment)))))

(define (print-point p)
  (newline)
  (display "(")
  (display (x-point p))
  (display ",")
  (display (y-point p))
  (display ")"))
```
