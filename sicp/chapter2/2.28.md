## Exercise 2.28

Write a procedure `fringe` that takes as argument a tree (represented as a list) and returns a list whose elements are all the leaves of the tree arranged in left-to-right order. For example,
(define x (list (list 1 2) (list 3 4)))
(fringe x)
(1 2 3 4)
(fringe (list x x))
(1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4)

**Ans**

```scheme
(define (fringe s)
    (cond ((null? s) null)
          ((not (pair? s)) (list s))
          (else (append (fringe (car s)) (fringe (cdr s))))))
```
