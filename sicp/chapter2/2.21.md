## Exercise 2.21

The procedure square-list takes a list of numbers as argument and returns a list of the squares of those numbers.

```scheme
(square-list (list 1 2 3 4))
(1 4 9 16)
```

Here are two different definitions of square-list . Complete both of them by filling in the missing expressions:

```scheme
(define (square-list items)
  (if (null? items)
      nil
      (cons ⟨ ?? ⟩ ⟨ ?? ⟩ )))

(define (square-list items)
  (map ⟨ ?? ⟩ ⟨ ?? ⟩ ))
```

**Ans**

```scheme
(define (square-list items)
  (if (null? items)
      null
      (cons (square (car items)) (square-list (cdr items)))))

(define (square-list-map items)
  (map (lambda (x) (square x)) items))

```
