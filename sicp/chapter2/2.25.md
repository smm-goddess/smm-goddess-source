## Exercise 2.25

Give combinations of `car` s and `cdr` s that will pick 7 from each of the following lists:
(1 3 (5 7) 9)
((7))
(1 (2 (3 (4 (5 (6 7))))))

**Ans**

```scheme
(1 3 (5 7) 9)
(car (cdr (car (cdr (cdr s)))))

((7))
(car (car s))

(1 (2 (3 (4 (5 (6 (7)))))))
(car (cdr (car (cdr (car (cdr (car (cdr (car (cdr (car (cdr s))))))))))))

```
