## Exercise 2.12

Define a constructor `make-center-percent` that takes a center and a percentage tolerance and produces the desired interval. You must also define a selector percent that produces the percentage tolerance for a given interval. The center selector is the same as the one shown above.

**Ans**

```scheme
(define (make-center-percent c p)
    (let ((width (abs (* c p))))
        (make-center-width c width)))

(define (percent interval)
    (/ (width interval) (center interval)))
```
